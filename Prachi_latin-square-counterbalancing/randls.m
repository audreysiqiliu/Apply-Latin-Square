% RANDLS   Generate a uniformly distributed random Latin square.
%    LS = RANDLS(N) returns an NxN matrix representative of a Latin square,
%    picked from an approximately uniform distribution on the space of
%    Latin squares of order N. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
%    proposed by Jacobson & Matthews [1] is used with the implementational
%    ideas proposed by Gallego Sagastume [2].
%    
%    LS = RANDLS(N, 'maxIter', I) performs I iterations at most (100000
%    by default).
% 
%    LS = RANDLS(N, 'nProper', P) iterates until P proper Latin squares
%    are obtained (2400 by default).
